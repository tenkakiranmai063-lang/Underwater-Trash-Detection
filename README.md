## 🗃️ Dataset

The project uses the [TrashCan Dataset](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/214865) — a public dataset of annotated underwater waste images captured in real marine environments.

**Dataset characteristics:**
- Real underwater environments with diverse lighting
- Plastic waste, debris, and natural underwater objects
- Bounding box annotations in YOLO format

> ⚠️ The `processed_dataset/` folder is **not included in this repository** due to file size constraints.
**Local path (development machine):**
```
C:\Users\harsha\Desktop\Underwater-Trash-Detection\processed_dataset
```

**To reproduce the processed dataset:**
1. Download the raw dataset from the [TrashCan Dataset page](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/214865)
2. Place the contents in a `raw_data/` folder at the project root
3. Run `notebooks/01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` to generate the processed version

**Customized Dataset Using RoboFlow**
For this project, a customized version of the dataset was created and processed using Roboflow.

The dataset was uploaded to Roboflow, where preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied to improve dataset quality, increase data diversity, and enhance the model's ability to detect underwater waste under different environmental conditions.

**⚙️ Preprocessing**
The following preprocessing techniques were applied:
- Image resizing to 640 × 640 pixels
- Auto-orientation of images
- Bounding box and label verification

**🔄 Data Augmentation**
To increase the diversity of the training data, the following augmentation techniques were applied:
- Horizontal flipping
- Rotation augmentation
- Brightness adjustment
- Blur augmentation

These augmentations help simulate variations commonly found in underwater environments, such as changes in object orientation, lighting conditions, image quality, and visibility.
⚠️ The customized and processed dataset is not included in this repository due to file size constraints.

## 🧠 Model Weights

The trained model weights (`trashcan_base_best.pt`) are hosted on Google Drive due to GitHub's file size limits.

| File | Description | Size | Link |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| `trashcan_base_best.pt` | Best checkpoint from 100-epoch training | ~22MB | [Download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vGWVdfm5f55NtQvWVsN-bfmvXwqgcXP/view?usp=sharing) |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshaVanamala/underwater-trash-detection.git
cd underwater-trash-detection
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

## 🚀 Usage

### Run inference on a single image

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("models/trashcan_base_best.pt")
results = model.predict("test_images_real/your_image.jpg", conf=0.25)
results[0].show()
```

### Run inference on a folder

```python
results = model.predict("test_images_real/", conf=0.25, save=True)
```

### Run the full pipeline via notebooks

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` | Clean and prepare the dataset |
| `02_model_training.ipynb` | Train YOLOv8s from scratch |
| `03_model_evaluation.ipynb` | Generate metrics and evaluation plots |
| `04_inferencedemo_.ipynb` | Run predictions on new images |
